        <div class="t5"><span>&emsp;&emsp;My mom is really concerned with the health of everyone in our family. In order to make sure all of us are in good health, she makes specific plans for us. For example, every morning, my dad has to have a bowl of egg soup while I have to eat an apple. My dad does not like the soup and I do not enjoy apples. I tell my mom that if we are forced eat things, we may become ill.</br>&emsp;&emsp;But she insists on us eating healthy food. Understanding her good intentions, I eat all the food that is provided by Mom with appreciation.
