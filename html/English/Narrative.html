        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;Last weekend，we took part in a picking activity.</br>&emsp;&emsp;We drove from the school, and the farm was about 2 kilometers away from our school. When we arrived at the farm, there are all kinds of animals, green fresh vegetables and fruit trees in the farm. We were divided into two groups. One group was responsible for picking fruits, the other packed up the fruits.</br>&emsp;&emsp;Time flying quickly, the activity was over. But it was a meaningful day, when we learnt a lot from it. Through this activity, we know how hard the farmers are and how precious the food is. We should treasure the food planted by the farmers.

        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;In order to encourage the students to have a grateful heart,an English speech contest named“Learn to Be Grateful”was organized by our school last Friday. </br>&emsp;&emsp;All the students in the senior grades went to watch it in the school hall. The judges were made up of 5 experienced English teachers from our school. There were 20 competitors,in total,attending it.They did an excellent job and the top 3 competitors were awarded.
</br>&emsp;&emsp;In my view,the contest is really meaningful and instructive. To be grateful is a traditional virtue of our nation,with which the world will be more harmonious.

        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;Last weekend we went to a community near our school to do some voluntary work. </br>&emsp;&emsp;When we got there in the morning, we were warmly welcomed by everybody. Soon we got down to work. Some of us went to the local nursing home to help the elderly with chores. They were glad to see so many young faces around them. The others joined the locals to clean up the neighborhood. We helped sweep the streets and collect rubbish. Soon the whole area took on a new look. 
</br>&emsp;&emsp;The activity did not last long, but we learned a lot. As the old saying goes,many hands make light work.I am sure,by joining our hands, we can accomplish big things and make the world a better place.
