        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;Last weekend，we took part in a picking activity.</br>&emsp;&emsp;We drove from the school, and the farm was about 2 kilometers away from our school. When we arrived at the farm, there are all kinds of animals, green fresh vegetables and fruit trees in the farm. We were divided into two groups. One group was responsible for picking fruits, the other packed up the fruits.</br>&emsp;&emsp;Time flying quickly, the activity was over. But it was a meaningful day, when we learnt a lot from it. Through this activity, we know how hard the farmers are and how precious the food is. We should treasure the food planted by the farmers.

        <div class="t1" style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;"><span>&emsp;&emsp;二、Learn to Be Grateful【活动】          
        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;In order to encourage the students to have a grateful heart,an English speech contest named“Learn to Be Grateful”was organized by our school last Friday. </br>&emsp;&emsp;All the students in the senior grades went to watch it in the school hall. The judges were made up of 5 experienced English teachers from our school. There were 20 competitors,in total,attending it.They did an excellent job and the top 3 competitors were awarded.
        </br>&emsp;&emsp;In my view,the contest is really meaningful and instructive. To be grateful is a traditional virtue of our nation,with which the world will be more harmonious.

        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;Last weekend we went to a community near our school to do some voluntary work. </br>&emsp;&emsp;When we got there in the morning, we were warmly welcomed by everybody. Soon we got down to work. Some of us went to the local nursing home to help the elderly with chores. They were glad to see so many young faces around them. The others joined the locals to clean up the neighborhood. We helped sweep the streets and collect rubbish. Soon the whole area took on a new look. 
        </span></div>
		<div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;The activity did not last long, but we learned a lot. As the old saying goes,many hands make light work.I am sure,by joining our hands, we can accomplish big things and make the world a better place.

        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;There are many respectable people around us. We are constantly moved and motivated by them. The person I respect most in my life is my mother.
		</span></div>
		<div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;My mother is a teacher of a Senior High. Devoted and faithful, she puts her heart and soul into her job. Not only does she care about every student's studies but also their physical and mental health. Besides, being a volunteer of our community, she often helps the children whose parents are too busy to look after them with their schoolwork. And as a mother, she is considerate and selfless. Whenever I run into problems, she always listens to me patiently and helps me out readily.
        </span></div>
		<div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;I respect my mum because of her devotion, integrity and selflessness, but most importantly, because she is my mother!

        </span></div>					
        <div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;With the growth of economy, wasting food is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, setting the National Food Security Publicity Week really counts. 
        </br><br>&emsp;&emsp;随着经济的发展，浪费食物的现象越来越严重。因此，设立国家粮食安全宣传周真的很重要。

		<div class="t2"><span>&emsp;&emsp;There is no denying that food has a profound impact on our life.First,as we all know,food is the necessity for anyone to survive,which plays a significant role in guaranteeing our countrys far-reaching development and keeping the society stable.So it is high time that everyone should be actively involved in cherishing food.For one thing,the government is surposed to raise peoples awareness of saving food.For another,as an individual,we should make it a habit to cherish food.        
		</br><br>&emsp;&emsp;不可否认，食物对我们的生活有着深远的影响。首先，众所周知，食物是每个人生存的必需品，它在保证我们国家的长远发展和社会稳定方面发挥着重要作用。现在是每个人都应该积极参与珍惜食物的时候了。首先，政府应该提高人们节约粮食的意识。另一方面，作为个人，我们应该养成珍惜食物的习惯。
